    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "**SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM has a number of real-world uses, including: Hand-writing detection, facial detection (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main strengths of this model are:\n",
    "1. The kernel trick to solve for boundary lines. This is one of the major advantages of SVC over logistic regression as it allows us to try classify data points using higher-dimension hyperplane polynomial or RBF functions. The main advantage of this is that it gives us a tool to assist in better dividing our data into seperate categories programatically and how to determine boundaries around that data.\n",
    "2. The optionality between polynomial and RBF kernels. This gives us futher tools in the case where polynomial based kernel optimisations are not sufficient, we also have the choice of trying a radial based function to try and classify our data set.\n",
    "3. A main difference in the error function between logistic regression gradient descent and SVM is the margin error, this means that SVM optimises not only based on classification but also on margin, trying to give you a classification line with the largest margin between data points with different state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would use them when classifying data that requires higher dimensions to seperate\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM tends to be performance poor the more dimensions we add to it. If we have extremely complex data with a large amount of features, SVM may be computationally intensive to optimise and more so to use algorithms such as gridsearch to solve for hyper parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are working with is quite complex with a moderate amount of feature sets. Based on this, I believe SVM may be a good choice however it may still be computationally intensive to resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naives Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. (2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model can be applied to predict spam emails\n",
    "This is done  via a previous example in this class, typically by converting messages to a bag of words array and calculating the probability that a message is spam given that it contains certain words.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Main strengths of the Naives Bayes classifier are that:\n",
    "1. It is extremely simple and scalable to use whilst still being very accurate as a classified\n",
    "2. If the Naive assumption holds that both events are independant of each other, it will tend to converge before other classifiers do, making it faster. Even if the naive assumption doesn't hold however, there is still evidence that it performs well as a predictor (3)\n",
    "3. A particular advantage of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is it's support for continuos values in classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It therefore makes sense to use this predictor when there is a large data set or a data set with many features and when we have computational restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incomplete training data (4): this algorithm requires conditional probabilities that sum to 1. If our data set is too small and skewed and therefore doesn't accurately represent the overall statistical population, our conditional probabilities may be very skewed.\n",
    "2. The Naive assumption: This is the assumption that our 2 events are independant. This is a fairly large assumption that one needs to make, however there is eveidence that even when this assumption doesn't hold, this algorithm can still perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a fairly large data set that has a large set of features after performing hot encoding which means that it may be computationally intesnive for some algorithms to optimise for, particularly when taking into account that we need to perform grid search optimisation. We also have a few text features as well as continuos value features which the Gaussian Naive bayes can efficiently handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be applied in almost every field as an ensemble method is merely combining multiple models to get a single output. Adaboost is a variation of this where we determine how we vote the output of each model to determine the overall output value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netflix host a competition for people to create it's new recommendation system in 2009, the winning team used ensemble methods with a host of algorithms to win  (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "The strengths of Adaboost is taking multiple weak learners and combining their strengths to form a single strong learner. It performs well in cases where weak learners are distinctive in seperating our data and either give us the truth or complete lies. In this scenario, many weak learners can be combined to create a powerful strong leader.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs poorly when all of our weak learners give ambiguous / random outputs. Due to adaboost essentially being a combination of weak models, if all of our weak models give random outputs and are indeterminate at classifying the state of our data, then the strong learner will be equally useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we will be using a decision tree classifier as the weak learner. The largest risk here is that we over fit our data by using too many decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we have a large data set made up of both discrete and continuos values, I believe a decision tree classifier may be appropriate. There is no inherent disadvantage to using adaboost to increase the predictability of our model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the above evaluation, I believe Adaboost to be the best algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metrics: In terms of metrics, whilst SVC outperforms Adaboost on lower sample sizes (1%, 10%) when using the full training set, Adaboost outperforms on both accuracy and f-score. On the testing data set, Adaboost performs the best on all sample sizes for both accuraccy and f-score. The value in the high f-score on the full data indicates that we are not overfitting the data by using too many decision classifiers and that we are getting a good prediction score, meaning we are getting a high amount of true positives in comparison to the total positive predictions we are making, indicating we won't cost the charity as much when using adaboost because we should minimise the number of predictions where we estimate the user earns over $50k p/ month and is therefore more likely to donate when in reality they don't earn over $50k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction/training time: Adaboost vastly outperformed SVC in the training and prediction time and still gave us the best accuraccy and f-scores. In comparison, Gaussian Naive bayes was trained and tested in the least amount of time overall however the difference to adaboost is negligible and in comparison of accuracy and f-score, adaboost by far outperformed Naives Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suitability for the data: As discussed in the previous answer, I believe that adaboost using decision tree classifiers is suitable for the data. This is based on the fact that decision classifiers work well with both continuos and discrete data features which our data has and also works well with large data sets. Combining this with an ensemble method works will with our data as our data has many features and is fairly large, meaning that it may make sense that combining many smaller weak learners to create one strong learner makes sense. Based on the f-score, I don't think our model is overfitting the data as it seems to marginally perform better on our test set than our training set which should not be the outcome if our data was overfitted."

We weight it very small if it gives as an equal amount of correct and incorrect classifications (random)\n",
